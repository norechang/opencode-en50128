## Notes

✅ **Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE WITH TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE** (2026-02-18)

**Original Approval Chain (Initial):**
- ✅ All 5 deliverables approved (SQAP v1.0, SQAP-Verification, SCMP v1.0, SVP v1.0, SVaP v1.0)
- ✅ Complete PM→VER→VAL→COD approval chain executed (20 approval chain entries)
- ✅ Gate check PASSED with 5/5 criteria met
- ✅ Baseline 0 established (2026-02-18)

⚠️ **Template Compliance Issue Identified & RESOLVED** (2026-02-18)

**Problem:** Planning documents (SQAP, SCMP, SVP, SVaP) missing mandatory template structure:
- Missing Document ID field (DOC-TYPE-YYYY-NNN format)
- Missing Document Control table (version history)
- Missing Approvals table (SIL 3 signature requirements)

**Root Cause:** Templates embedded in SKILL.md rather than separate files

**Resolution:**
1. ✅ Created comprehensive template system (.opencode/skills/en50128-documentation/templates/)
2. ✅ Regenerated 4 documents (SQAP v2.0, SCMP v2.0, SVP v2.0, SVaP v2.0) with proper structure
3. ✅ Updated QUA and VER commands to enforce template compliance
4. ✅ Re-executed full approval chain (PM→VER→VAL→COD) for 4 regenerated documents
5. ✅ VER verified template compliance for all documents (Document ID ✓, Document Control ✓, Approvals ✓)

**Re-Approval Results:**
- ✅ SQAP v2.0 (DOC-SQAP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SCMP v2.0 (DOC-SCMP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SVP v2.0 (DOC-SVP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SVaP v2.0 (DOC-SVAP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SQAP-Verification: No changes needed - APPROVED

**Approval Chain Statistics:**
- Total approval chain entries: 40 (20 initial + 4 regeneration + 16 re-approval)
- Template compliance verifications: 4 (all passed)
- Documents regenerated: 4
- Gate checks passed: 2 (initial + re-approval)

**Key Achievements:**
1. ✅ All planning documents now EN 50128 template compliant (SIL 3 mandatory requirement)
2. ✅ Template compliance enforcement added to QUA and VER agents
3. ✅ Complete audit trail of template compliance fix (40 approval chain entries)
