```
2026-02-18 | SQAP | Planning | draft | complete | PM | alice.smith | Ready for verification

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE - Gate check PASSED (5/5 criteria)!
2. ✅ Baseline 0 established with all 5 deliverables approved
3. Begin Phase 2 (Requirements):
   - Establish Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
   - USER APPROVAL REQUIRED for all requirement activities
   - Create Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
   - Create Hazard Log (SAF)
   - Create Overall Software Test Specification (TST)
4. Use /req, /saf, /tst agents to establish requirements phase deliverables

### Current Phase Completion (Phase 2: Requirements)
- [ ] Establish SRS (REQ) - requires USER APPROVAL
- [ ] Establish RTM (REQ)
- [ ] Establish Hazard Log (SAF)
- [ ] Establish Overall Software Test Specification (TST)
- [ ] Establish Software Requirements Verification Report (VER)

### Ready for Gate Check?
**Status**: No  
**Gate**: requirements  
**Command**: `/cod gate-check requirements` (after all deliverables validated)

## Notes

✅ **Full Workflow Test COMPLETE - Phase 1 (Planning) PASSED!**

**Success Summary:**
- ✅ All 5 deliverables approved (SQAP, SQAP-Verification, SCMP, SVP, SVaP)
- ✅ Complete PM→VER→VAL→COD approval chain executed (20 approval chain entries)
- ✅ Gate check PASSED with 5/5 criteria met
- ✅ Baseline 0 established (2026-02-18)
- ✅ Build system configured (Makefile, tool-configuration.md)
- ✅ Independence requirements verified (VAL reports to Safety Authority, not PM)
- ✅ SIL 3 strict gatekeeper mode enforced successfully

**Key Achievements:**
1. Complete approval chain audit trail (20 entries in history table)
2. All deliverables validated by independent VER and VAL before COD approval
3. Tool configuration documented and verified
4. Project setup complete (directory structure, build system, team organization)

**Comparison to Fast-Track Test:**
- Fast-track: 4 deliverables (SQAP-Verification skipped)
- Full workflow: 5 deliverables (SQAP-Verification included)
- Fast-track: 16 approval chain entries
- Full workflow: 20 approval chain entries
- Both tests: Successfully demonstrated SIL 3 independence and approval chain enforcement

Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Requirements.
USER APPROVAL REQUIRED for all requirement establishment/modification activities.
Assessment phase (Phase 7) will be required for SIL 3.
