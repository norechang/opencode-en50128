## Deliverable Approval Chain History

This section tracks all status transitions for deliverables through the approval chain.

| Date | Deliverable | Phase | From Status | To Status | Role | Approved By | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

**Approval Chain Rules**:
- PM can mark: `draft`, `complete`
- VER can mark: `verified`, `rejected` (requires `complete` first)
- VAL can mark: `validated`, `rejected` (requires `verified` first for SIL 3-4)
- COD can mark: `approved` (requires `validated` for SIL 3-4, or `complete` for SIL 0-2)

**Examples**:
```
2026-02-18 | SQAP | Planning | draft | complete | PM | alice.smith | Ready for verification
2026-02-19 | SQAP | Planning | complete | verified | VER | bob.jones | Verification passed, all checks OK
